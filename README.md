Credit Card Fraud Detection

"Overview"
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

"Features"
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression for classification.
Performance Evaluation: Accuracy assessment of the model.

"Technologies Used"
